# D-GIS 
D-GIS is a decentralized geospatial/geological data sharing platform based on Ethereum.

## Features
The main idea of D-GIS is that it allows scientists to transfer their studies between each other, all by making use of the revolutionary blockchain technology. It can also be used by individuals or organizations to sell their work.

Features that make D-GIS better are:

 - Completely decentralized networking
 - Local and network-wide reputation system allowing users to create a "trustworthy" profile over the nodes
 - Data is distributed based on zones, called "Globals", thus allowing to shape a network of geospatial data which corresponds to a specific zone.
 - Democratic and "lightly-regulated" market

## How to use
D-GIS relies on a "hybrid-chain" model, which means that half of its components are located inside the Ethereum blockchain and the rest is operated on a machine.
To make use of this platform you have to setup a GoServer, which is more or less a "gateway" to access the network and interact with other peers. GoServer is built on top of go-ethereum and leaves users with a light-weight app on their PC/Smartphone/WebApp in order to manage their data and perform transactions. Once the GoServer is ready and initialized you have to register your machines or devices on it, allowing the server to do the heavy work in a separate machine.

More over, you can use an already set-up server in order to access the network, you don't really need to setup your own.

## Status
D-GIS is still under development, a white paper will be available ASAP.
